The story:

Ever found a plugin that promises to save you a lot of money ? Mine will do just the opposite - and for a fair cause, too ! ;-)

Recent personal donations I sent triggered nice thank-you messages for example from Yoast, or (find sse paypal). At the WordPress WordCamp2013 event in Paris, we discussed donations to plugins developer and how they seemed few and far between, and at WordCamp Paris 2014 a speaker
rigthfully underlined that projects managers completing a creation partially based on WordPress community plugins should think ahead of donation representing a tiny amount of the project total budget.
Therefore I thought it might be interesting to distribute such a reminder from within the admin section of the site. Not that anybody could not calculate mentally, but I thought having a list of the helpful plugins they used with their authors name and donations links could entice good moves and remind beginners of what such a great community is about ;-)
